Therefore, SPIRiT is based on GRAPPA's reconstruction, but with improved generalisability from a SENSE-like inverse problem formulation."

    "### SPIRiT formulation\n",
    "SPIRiT is formulated as an inverse problem with \"Consistency constraints\". The desired reconstruction, $x$, from an arbitrary k-space pattern, is a complete Cartesian  k-space for all coils. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consistency with the Calibration\n",
    "SPIRiT's consistency with the calibration is an expanded notion of consistency from GRAPPA. While GRAPPA ensures consistency between synthesized point and nearby acquired points, SPIRiT ensures consistency between all points, synthesized or acquired, across all points in neighbourhood of $r$. SPIRiT also ensures consistency across coils.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a slightly different formulation to GRAPPA:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_i(r) = \\sum_j g_{ji}^*(R_r x_j) \\tag{5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three differences to GRAPPA in this formulation:\n",
    "* $R_r$ instead of $\\hat{R}_r$: consistency is enforced on synthesised and acquired points\n",
    "* $g_{ji}$ instead of $g_{rji}$: kernel is the same for all positions, and operates on all points in neighbourhood\n",
    "* $x_j$ instead of $x_i$: neighbourhood region across all coils \n",
    "* Coupled instead of decoupled linear equations \n",
    "\n",
    "Since consistency is ensured across all points, this can be reformulated as a convolution ($\\otimes$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_i = \\sum_j g_{ji} \\otimes x_j \\tag{6}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregating the $g_{ji}$'s into a matrix $G$, gives the simpler representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x=Gx \\tag{7}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is intuitive considering that correct calibration consistency should synthesise all points in any subset of \n",
    "$x$ to $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/sampling_patterns.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consistency with the Data Acquisition \n",
    "SPIRiT's consistency with the data acquisition ensures consistency with the non-necessarily cartesian, acquired data $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y=Dx \\tag{8}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $y$ is the concatenated data from all coils\n",
    "* $D$ is a linear operator mapping the cartesian coordinates of the final reconstructed solution to the acquired data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combined Optimisation Formulation \n",
    "These two consistency considerations can be formulated into:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\arg\\min_x ||(G-I)x||^2 \\tag{9}$$ subject to $$||Dx-y||^2 \\le \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \n",
    "* $\\epsilon$ is a threshold to trade-off calibration and data acquisition consistency. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is advantageous as the minimisation is on the calibration consistency which is always in cartesian coordinates even if $y$ is not. Alternatively, this can be formulated in an unconstrained Lagrangian form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\arg\\min_x||Dx-y||^2 + \\lambda(\\epsilon)||(G-I)x||^2 \\tag{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is solved iteratively through descent methods, all of which rely on rapid computation of the objective function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_x\\{||Dx-y||^2 + \\lambda(\\epsilon)||(G-I)x||^2\\} = 2D^*(Dx-y)+\\lambda2(G-I)^*(G-I)x \\tag{11}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a steepest descent algorithm with step size $\\mu$ would iterate as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\mu[D^*(D-y)+\\lambda(G-I)^*(G-I)x] \\tag{12}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arbitrary Cartesian Sampling\n",
    "In the specific case where the sampling is also cartesian, then it is common to enforce the data acquisition equality constraint ($\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\arg\\min_x||Dx-y||^2 + \\lambda||(G-I)x||^2 \\tag{13}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "A useful reformulation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = D^Ty + D_c^T \\hat{x} \\tag{14}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where: \n",
    "* $\\hat{x}$ are all non-acquired points\n",
    "* $D$ is a linear map, but now only for acquired points\n",
    "    * $D^T$ is its inverse\n",
    "* $D_c$ is a similar linear map, but only for nonacquired points ($\\hat{x}$)\n",
    "* $D_c^T$ is its inverse\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting this into the above Lagragian formulation gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\arg\\min_x||D(D^Ty + D_c^T)-y||^2 + \\lambda||(G-I)(D^Ty + D_c^T \\hat{x})||^2$$\n",
