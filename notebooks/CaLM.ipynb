That means the different $\\alpha_i$ share the approximatelty the same support, but not necessarily the same values at the non-zero entries. This follows from the assumption that the sensitivity maps $S_i$ are smooth and therefore the multiplication $x_i = S_i x$ will yield discontinuities at the same positions as the image $x$.
